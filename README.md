# PROJECT-Remote-Infiltration
[ Cybersecurity Project ]  

=> Automated remote data collection processes, significantly reducing data collection time and handling installation and coding failures by developing Bash scripts to automate script execution and application installation on remote servers, thereby enhancing efficiency and reliability in data gathering processes.

=> Ensured anonymity (NIPE) by checking and running appropriate programs to mask IP addresses and countries. Conducted network
scans for open ports and connected to remote servers to perform network scans (NMAP & WHOIS) and download data.

=> Collected and logged downloaded data onto local machines, auditing the data collection process for accuracy and completeness.

Project under Cybersecurity Vocational Training Programme, Centre for Cybersecurity.
